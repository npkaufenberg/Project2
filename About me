<p>My name is Nick Kaufenberg, and I am an Airman in the United States Air Force, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Applied Social Sciences. My academic journey began in Boston, transitioned to Madison, and now, after a brief hiatus, I am determined to complete my degree. As a devoted husband and father of two, Roy and Malcolm, my life is a beautiful chaos that never ceases to amaze me. This course is another step towards my goal of lifelong learning and completion of my Bachelor's degree.</p>
