<h1>About Me -- Nick Kaufenberg</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\npkau\Pictures\Kidsme.jpg">
<p>Greetings LIS500 facualty and students...My name is Nick Kaufenberg and I am an Applied Social Sciences major here at Madison. I began my collegiate journey in 2001 in Boston Massachussetts at Northeastern University. An interesting note about this time is my flight to Boston for orientation was scheduled to leave at 11:45 out of MSP on 9/11, 2001. I left school with 12 credits left to complete my Political Science and Legal Studies degree in 2005 after the unexpected passing of my dad. Since then, I have become a 15 year veteran in the United States Air Force as an aviator on the C-130's. I've completed culinary school at the Arts Institute- Minneapolis. Owned a successful food truck in the Twin Cities and opened a small bistro within a local brewery. All this could not be done without the support of my wife of 11 years and the unconditional love of my two sons, Roy and Mac.
