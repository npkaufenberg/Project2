<p>My name is Nick Kaufenberg, and I am an Airman in the United States Air Force, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Applied Social Sciences. My academic journey began in Boston, transitioned to Madison, and now, after a brief hiatus, I am determined to complete my degree. As a devoted husband and father of two, Roy and Malcolm, my life is a beautiful chaos that never ceases to amaze me. This course is another step towards my goal of lifelong learning and completion of my Bachelor's degree.</p>
  <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://diversity.ncsu.edu/news/2019/09/13/why-we-must-understand-and-address-implicit-bias-2/">
  Implicit biases simultaneously advantage certain groups while disadvantaging others. These biases can be seen in university admissions, job recruiting and selection, and even in the classroom. These biases greatly affect diversity in a number of ways.
